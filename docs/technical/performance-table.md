# Performance table

How long each action in HDR Finisher takes, against its target. Use it to
choose performance work, and to spot regressions: a new measurement well
outside its recorded range needs a one-line note, even when it is still
inside the target.

Started October 30, 2026 by Claude from the module PRDs and the October 30
logs. Keep it current: whenever a change, test or log review produces a
timing, update its row (range, date, commit, conditions) in the same commit.

## How to read and update it

* **Target:** an agreed target (with who agreed it and when) or
  "proposed". Only Steve agrees targets.
* **Measured:** a range (p50 to max, or min to max), never a single best
  run. Timings vary run to run; judge them against the target and the range
  (AGENTS.md, "Work within tolerances").
* **Conditions:** what was measured. Cold means never prepared. Warm means
  stored pictures existed. It also gives the folder, the commit, and
  Steve's machine or a disposable copy. Steve's photos are on D:, a
  removable exFAT drive, so file reads are slower than an internal SSD.
* **Status:** Met, Not met, Unknown (no target or no recent measurement),
  or Baseline (a regression reference with no target).
* **Sources:** Steve's runs, read from
  `%APPDATA%\hdr-finisher-desktop\logs\backend.log` with
  `codebase/tools/summarize_library_log.py --since "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"`;
  scripted runs (for example `codebase/tools/measure-library-cold-mixed.cjs`);
  the dated PRD entries named in each row.
* Stage names in the logs (`page_picture_*`, `picture_*`, `startup_phase`)
  are given so the next measurement can be found quickly.

## 8. Gaps to fill

No recent number for:

* Grade: opening a photo, slider latency at Fit and 100% for each tool,
  HDR/SDR switch.
* Library: HDR/SDR switch in the grid, paste to many photos, rename, move
  and Delete.
* A cold-launch measurement of each startup target.
* One timing per supported file type (scheduler design, phase 0).
