# Prioritized performance fix ledger — September 30, 2026

Steve requested investigation of all prioritized areas, targeted repairs, and a separate commit after each fix. This ledger extends the [first targeted pass](high-impact-performance-changes-2026-09-30.md). Measurements from different implementations remain separate.

| Area | Current evidence / action | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CPU masks / automatic anchors | Stroke-bound accumulation committed `2f12520`; bounded feather prefix sums added next | In progress |
| Drag input backpressure | Correlation and main-thread work investigation pending | Open |
| CPU routing / request churn | Transient post-Match GPU recovery committed `6b0d83f`; unsupported-local CPU request churn still open | In progress |
| GPU mask cache growth | Identity/lifetime/eviction investigation pending | Open |
| Match / cold Exact Peak | Candidate reuse and peak-stage investigation pending | Open |
| Active-edit endurance | 30–45-minute replay after fixes, preserving automatic anchors | Pending |

## Bounded feather prefix sums

Each axis now runs independent row/column strips through the same edge-extended float32 prefix-sum filter. Vertical strips are transposed to contiguous rows. Summation order per pixel is unchanged. Scratch work stays bounded instead of allocating padding, cumulative, concatenation and result arrays at native frame size for every one of the twelve blur passes.

An isolated seeded 7,362 × 4,908 float32 mask, sigma 400, six horizontal and six vertical box passes measured:

| Implementation | Time ms | Process peak working set bytes | Float SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Original whole-frame | 3,476.6 | 977,539,072 | `cdbbc69a929684e478d2d40453d6351496002af64bea6e67574f2834103cf463` |
| Bounded strips | 3,401.0 | 553,406,464 | Same |

This is one isolated observation per implementation, not a stable latency estimate. It demonstrates about 43% lower process peak working set with identical output. Early smaller-strip prototypes were 5–11% slower; the retained implementation uses larger bounded strips and avoids an extra division-result allocation. No full-workflow memory or endurance-tail improvement is claimed from this microbenchmark alone.

Verification covers axes, radii larger than image dimensions, non-divisible strip dimensions, low-alpha twelve-pass feather and quantization. Commands from `ai/codebase`:
